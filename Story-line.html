  <h1>Story-line</h1>
  
  <p class="a">Long ago, the ancient Egyptians who worshiped the goddess of war 
    and healing, Sekhmet, would go up to her temple every month, before sunset.
    The temple was located far from the village, and the journey was rough. 
    However, the ancient Egyptians would bring Sekhmet a sacrifice every month 
    in exchange for peace and prosperity. The contract between the village and the 
    goddess was working for everyone, and all were satisfied. This tradition 
    continued for many years, until a different tribe arrived. They called 
    themselves “the Disea tribe”, and they traveled far and wide in search of 
    Sekhmet's temple. You see, this tribe was not as lucky as the village. They 
    suffered from diseases and infection. Back in their village, young and old 
    were dying to a ferocious disease they called “Hama”. Hama was a fast 
    spreading disease that killed everyone it touched. Not knowing what to do, 
    the Disea tribe went in search of the temple that belonged to the goddess 
    of healing. When they arrived at the Vacci village, it’s people were not 
    happy. They were kept from disease for so long, and it was all thanks to 
    the goddess. When the Disea tribe explained their situation to the Native 
    people of Vacci, they didn’t want to give up their goddess. They were 
    selfish, and hoped that thanks to Sekhmet they would outlive all others, 
    becoming the superior village. So they refused to show the tribe where the 
    temple was located, and chased them away. When the goddess found out of what
    her village did to Disea, she unleashed her wrath upon them. The disease 
    Hama was released, and now nothing could save the Vacci people. The disease 
    kept spreading and spreading, killing all in its way. Some developed an 
    immunity, but it passed after 10 days. Many were killed by this infecting 
    disease. This continued on for 4 whole months, only a little of the village 
    remaining. They went to Sekhmet's temple, begging for forgiveness. The 
    goddess decided to take pity on them, but it came with a price. There is 
    only one thing you can do now, she said. The healthiest of you shall travel 
    to the land of Disea, and beg for their forgiveness. You will then come back 
    with water from their rivers, leaves from their trees, and berries form their 
    gardens. Once you have these ingredients, you will come back to your home land,
    returning with the chief of Disea. You will give the ingredients to me, and 
    through the combining of these ingredients I will make a magic liquid that can
    heal the diseased. I will make two batches, so bring enough ingredients. One 
    batch will go to your village, and the other to theirs. Now go! But hurry, 
    before there's nothing to return to. With these news, those who traveled to 
    the temple, packed their bags and were on their way. Once the men from Vacci 
    arrived, the chief of Disea was not happy. The people of Disea raised their 
    weapons and were ready to attack, until the Vacci men started talking. “We 
    wish you no harm, and seek forgiveness” spoke one of them. “We wish to not 
    only share the goddesses' magic with you, but we offer you a magic liquid 
    that can heal the sick”. With those words, the Disea people agreed, “we agree
    to give you the ingredients, but you must promise to bring us back the magic 
    liquid. If you do not, then we will declare war against you, and a brutal 
    battle will take place in your once peaceful village”. The Vacci people 
    agreed, and so the two tribes traveled back to the Vacci village together. 
    They gave the goddess the Magic liquid, and she made a magical liquid with 
    the properties to heal anyone who suffers from the terrible disease called 
    “Hama”. After both villages were restored to full health, Sekhmet locked 
    away the disease in a beautiful vase that was sealed away in her temple. 
    If anyone were to open it the disease would be released back to earth, and 
    infect everything in its path. Just in case, the goddess made another batch 
    of the magic liquid. She put it in a different vase, and placed it in the 
    centre of the village. This was in case the disease comes back, and to cure 
    those who need to re heal. She called the magic liquid a “Vaccine”, named 
    after the village Vacci.</p>

  <p class="a">Hama, and the vaccine have been stored in Sekhmet's temple for the longest 
    of time, until a couple of archeologists in the 20th century found the vases 
    and brought them to a local museum. The vases remained safe, behind a glass 
    cover, and with the security of the museum. One day, two siblings were brought
    to the museum, and while playing with a ball broke through the glass, and 
    shttereted the vase containing Hama. The disease infected them, spreading 
    like wildfire. It is now up to you to take the vaccine and stop the disease
    before it's too late. Be quick for if more then 125 people die, the disease
    will be unstoppable. Goodluck player 1, and think of a strategy to help you
    out.</p>
