  <h1>Rules</h1>
  
  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <h3>Save the world before 125 people die</h3>
 
  <h2>Backround info:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="b">You can vaccinate people by clicking on the green circles (aka people)</li>
    <li class="b">Each circle represents a person</li>
    <li class="b">Each second in real life represents a day in the game</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How long does each ability lasts:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="b">Vaccine: 25 days</li>
    <li class="b">Immunity: 12 days</li>
    <li class="b">Infection: spreads every 10 days</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Each day:</h2>
  <h3>The game begins with a 
    bunch of green dots on a canvas, 
    two of which are red. The red dots are 
    infected, and every 10 days the disease spreads 
    from the red circle to its neighbors. Keep in 
    mind that in order to be infected the person needs 
    to be right next to the red circle. Throughout the game
    you will see that the people are of various colors,
    that is because each color represents a status. In total
    there are 5 statuses, and 5 different colors. Here is what
    each color represents:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="b">Red: Sick</li>
    <li class="b">Green: Healthy</li>
    <li class="b">Yellow: Immune</li>
    <li class="b">Blue: Vaccinated</li>
    <li class="b">Black: dead</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>You will notice that on the right side of the canvas
  there are numbers, those numbers show how many sick, healthy,
  immune, vaccinated, and dead people there are.</h3
